# My Slock Build

[Slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/) [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) package with a few patches installed to keep things nice:

+ [mediakeys](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/mediakeys/)
+ [quickcancel](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/quickcancel/)

## Installation

```
makepkg -si
```

## Further Notes

* On my laptop slock is wonky. Switched to [i3lock](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/) until this project gets some love.
